# This script starts a user-space SSH daemon listening on port 12345
# It is mainly intended to be run inside a container to enable vscode integration.
# In general, it is expected that you will be running this script inside a singularity container.

# Note that due to the isolation rules of singularity the started SSH daemon here may outlive the container.
# This may prevent you from starting another SSH daemon if you launch a new instance of your container.
# In order to avoid this issue, you may kill the daemon process directly
#
# First run `ps -u $USER` and look for `sshd` processes with high PIDs,
# these correspond to the processes started inside a container.
# You may simply stop them with `kill -9 PID` where PID is the value you observed from the previous command.
